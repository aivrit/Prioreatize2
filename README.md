To run the site:
clone this repository to you local machine (must be a windows machine)
make sure a mongo db server is running on your local machine with anonymous login enabled (listening on port 27017)
make sure node.js and gulp are installed on your local machine (npm install -g gulp)
open the command line in the main folder of this repo (where the gulpfile is) and simply run "gulp". (this will take ~30 sec)
